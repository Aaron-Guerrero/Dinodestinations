## Challenges

We ran into numerous challenges. Setting up the API to Google Maps was one major challenge. Another was setting up a database to collect user information. Once a domain name was set aide - using porkbun to get the website displaying properly also proved a challenge - which was ultimately not overcome.

## Future Enhancements

In the near future, we plan on implementing a host/domain for the website. We also would like to add addiional features to enhance user experience like a community chat, dinosour games, and more!
